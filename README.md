# Preqin Technical Interview

Hello! If you are reading this, then we're likely in the process of chatting with you about a technical role at Preqin. If so, congratulations!

To move forward, we'd like to know a bit about how you work. We'd like you to demonstrate your skills and abilities with these coding tasks. You'll then have the opportunity to showcase your work to some of our engineering team, discuss your solution, explain what you might do differently with more time, and answer any questions.

This exercise is not graded or scored; it is designed to give us a sample of your thought processes as an engineer.

## Guidelines for the take-home test:

- **Flexible Timing:** We're a global team spread across multiple time zones, and we hire candidates from diverse locations. This asynchronous exercise allows you to showcase your skills at a time and place that works for you.

- **Paced Work:** Each task is designed to take around an hour. While we suggest limiting your time investment, you are free to spend as much time as you need to best represent your skills.

- **Reflective of Our Work**: As a remote team, much of our work involves self-directed problem-solving, followed by iterative review and refinement. This exercise mirrors that workflow.

- **Reduced Anxiety**: This format eliminates the stress of pair programming with someone you just met.

- **Preferred Tools**: You can use the tools, languages, and frameworks that make you most productive.

- **Show Your Craft**: Demonstrate your process through commits, unit tests, running code, and deployment considerations.
